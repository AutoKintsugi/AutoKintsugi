# Kintsugi CLI Application

This CLI application is designed to support smaller Vault Operators (VOs) participating in the Kintsugi ecosystem. Its purpose is to help manage exposures to multiple crypto assets, automate self-issuing, harvesting rewards, and farming BTC. By providing these capabilities, the application aims to make running small VOs more attractive, thereby increasing network issuance while maintaining decentralization.

## Features

- **Decentralized Wrapped BTC**: The application aims to create the most decentralized wrapped BTC token insured by collateral.
- **Encouraging Decentralization**: The network intends to attract high quantities of smaller VOs instead of a few whale accounts to promote decentralization.
- **Automated Management**: The CLI application automates various processes, including self-issuing, reward harvesting, and BTC farming.
- **Collateral Ratio Management**: The application helps VOs manage the collateral ratio, ensuring it stays within the desired range by monitoring the markets and reacting to price fluctuations of both KBTC and collateral assets such as KSM.
- **Increase Network Issuance**: By providing support to smaller VOs, the application aims to increase network issuance while maintaining a decentralized environment.

## Prerequisites

Before using the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Node version 18 and later
2. Kintsugi vault fully set up
3. Sufficient KINT balance in your vault
4. Seed phrase of your vault
5. (for some scripts) Free KAR balance on Karura chain

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the application:

1. Create a local seed phrase file somewhere on your filesystem, e.g., `mkdir ~/.private && touch ~/.private/seed.txt && vim ~/.private/seed.txt`
2. Change permissions to make the file readable only by the owner, e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.private/seed.txt`
3. Change the file owner to root, e.g., `sudo chown root seed.txt`
4. In the repository directory, create a local environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
5. Replace the seed path in the `.env` file with the absolute path to the seed phrase file created in step 1
6. Install the required libraries by running `yarn`

> :warning: Use this application at your own risk. We take no responsibility for any loss of funds.

> :warning: Poor performance may occur if the WSS RPC endpoints are busy or slow. Consider changing the `.env` RPC configuration if you experience performance issues.

To start the application, run the following command:
yarn start


## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the application:

- **Self Issuance Workflow**: Supports self-mint issue requests.
- **Harvest & Compound Workflow**: Enables the harvesting of rewards and compounding.
- **Rebalancing Vault with LP**: Facilitates vault rebalancing using LP.

Please exercise caution and conduct proper research before using any of these scripts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this application going to steal my funds?**

A: The application utilizes the official Parity `@polkadot/api` library to generate a signer key using your seed phrase. You can review the code and see how the seed phrase is used securely. The relevant code can be found in `utils/helpers.ts
